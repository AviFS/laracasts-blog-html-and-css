I got a bit obsessive tabbing between the final version on Github, and what I had at the end of the series, to make mine match to the pixel. I didn't make any huge changes, it was just some responsive text sizing, margins and displays iirc. As far as I can tell, at both desktop and mobile breakpoints, what I have matches exactly.

That is, except for the footer in `post.html` which *I swear* doesn't match the footer in `index.html`. Please check to confirm my sanity! Anyway, that'll be made consistent once we extract that into a partial/component. So I left the footer the same as it is in `index.html` for both.

I thought I'd share my repo here, in case it helps anyone. It looks like there are a lot of commits to follow in Laracasts' commit history, so if you wanna follow along from my "end of series" commit, you can see what changes I made from there to make it responsive, and to match Laracasts'. I hope it helps someone!
